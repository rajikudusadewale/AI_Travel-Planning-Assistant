# An AI-Powered Travel Planning Assistant


Travel planning can often be time-consuming and overwhelming, with numerous details to consider. To simplify this process, I developed a Travel Planning Assistant using OpenAI's advanced APIs. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the project:

**Project Overview:**

**1. Generating Travel Itineraries:**
Using the Chat Completion API, the assistant generates detailed, day-by-day travel itineraries tailored to the user's destination and preferences.

**2. Visualizing Destinations:**
With the help of the DALL-E API, the assistant creates stunning flowcharts of the travel plans.

**3. Voice Interaction:**
Incorporating the TTS Model, users can interact with the assistant using voice commands, allowing for a hands-free experience while planning their travels.

**Features:**

- **Personalized Itineraries:** Get customized travel plans that suit your interests and schedule.
- **Destination Visuals:** See beautiful images of your travel spots, enhancing your planning experience.
- **Voice Commands:** Use voice to hear the assistant, making the process more convenient and efficient.
